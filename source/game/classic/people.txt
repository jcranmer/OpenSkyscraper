This document documents detailed simulation characteristics detailing people.

70x.bmp contains the bitmaps for people. Each index refers to 1/8 the leftmost
pixel of the bitmap rectangle. Characters 6, 8, and 10 take up two of these
blocks.
0 - Office #2, Office #3, Condo #0, Hotel #1+, Outsider even
1 - Office #0, Office #1
2 - Office #4, Outsider #1
3 - Condo #2, 
4 - Office #5, Hotel #0, Outsider #3
5 - Security
6/7 - Outsider #5
8/9 - Condo #1, Outsider #7
10/11 - Housekeeping

Note: the numbers refer to the index of the person in the tenant, so #0 is the
first person. These are invariate. For "outsiders" (anyone marked as going to
some sort of retail), the number refers to only the low 3 bits of the value.

700.bmp = Black people
701.bmp = Red people
702.bmp = Blue people
703.bmp = Yellow people

Each person is invariably from a single location; this is the tenant with which
they are associated.

Stress, eval, and all that
==========================
Eval and stress go on a scale between 0 and 300. There are two thresholds:
0 <= eval < 80: High (blue) eval
80 <= eval < 150 or 200: Medium (yellow) eval
150 or 200 <= eval <= 300: Low (red) eval

The medium-high boundary depends on your tower level; on towers of 4 or higher,
the eval is 200, otherwise it's 150.

Eval appears to merely be an average of the individual stress runs for each
trip, over some period of time (day? quarter? all time?).

Stress is accumulated as a function of waiting time for elevators, and some
constant value for stairs and escalators. I haven't done enough studying to
find these constant values...

The average evaluation of all tenants determines how "happy" a tenant is for
some tenant types; evaluation of visitors also determines how many visitors a
retail shop will get the next time, and probably plays into the population of
the retail units as well.
